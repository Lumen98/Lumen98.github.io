        <h1>Snake Classic<h1>
        <p>
          Snake is one of those instantly recognizable games for everyone. It brings
          back a nostalgia that is unreplicable. I wanted to remake this game but with my own 
          custom features. The project is a rendition of the classic Snake game developed using 
          the LibGDX framework. The game is designed to be played in a grid where the snake moves 
          around, consuming apples to grow in size, while avoiding collisions with itself, rocks, 
          and rotten apples. (hint those are the new features)<br><br>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <p>
        1. Game Initialization<br><br>
        The game is launched using the GameLauncher class. Screen dimensions 
        are set using constants for width and height. The game instance is 
        created using the Snake class.<br><br>
        2. Game Components<br><br>
         Snake: The snake is represented by a head (SnakeHead) and a body (SnakePart). 
        The snake moves in different directions based on user input.<br><br>
        Apple: Represented by the Apple class. When the snake consumes an apple, it grows in size.<br><br>
        Rock: Represented by the Rock class. Colliding with a rock ends the game.<br><br>
        Rotten Apples: Represented by the RottenApples class. Consuming a rotten apple 
        clears the snake’s body and resets the score. (You definitely do not want to hit this...)<br><br>
        3. Game Mechanics<br><br>
        The snake’s movement is controlled using arrow keys.
        The game checks for collisions with apples, rocks, rotten apples, the snake’s body, 
        and the game’s boundaries. The game keeps track of the player’s score and high score, 
        which is saved using Preferences. The game features a grid background to represent the 
        playing field.<br><br>
        4. Graphics and Visualization<br><br>
        The game uses ShapeRenderer for drawing game components. The snake’s head is represented 
        using a texture image (snakeHeadPic). The game has a menu screen with a “START!” button.
        The game displays the current score and high score on the screen.<br><br>
        5. Game Flow<br><br>
        The game starts with a menu screen. Upon clicking “START!”, the game begins. The game 
        continues until the snake collides with a rock, the game’s boundaries, or itself.
        If the game ends, the player is returned to the menu screen.<br><br>
        6. Utility Classes<br><br>
        Constants: A class that holds various constants used throughout the game, such as screen 
        dimensions and grid size.<br><br>
        Direction: An enumeration representing the possible directions the snake can move in.<br><br>
