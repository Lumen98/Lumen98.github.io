        <h1>Falling Sand Game<h1>
        <p>
          This Falling Sand Game is a Java-based console application designed to 
          visually simulate the behavior of various particles, such as sand, water, 
          and ice. The application provides a graphical representation of these particles 
          and their interactions in a grid-based environment.<br><br>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <p>
        1. User Interaction through GUI<br><br>
        The application utilizes Javaâ€™s AWT and Swing libraries to create an 
        interactive graphical interface. Users can select different particle 
        types and place them on a grid. The application displays the movement 
        and interactions of these particles in real time.<br><br>
        2. Particle Simulation<br><br>
        The system supports various particle types, including:<br><br>
        Empty (Eraser)<br><br>
        Metal<br><br>
        Water<br><br>
        Sand<br><br>
        Ice<br><br>
        Glass<br><br>
        Each particle type has its unique behavior and interactions with other particles. 
        For example, sand particles fall downwards until they hit another particle, and 
        ice particles can melt into water over time.<br><br>
        3. Visualization<br><br>
        The SandDisplay class is responsible for the visualization of the grid and particles.
        Each cell in the grid can contain a particle, and the color of the cell represents 
        the type of particle it contains. The application updates and repaints the display in 
        real time to show particle movements and interactions.<br><br>
        4. User Controls<br><br>
        Users can interact with the application using mouse clicks to place particles on the grid.
        A slider allows users to adjust the simulation speed. Buttons enable users to select the 
        type of particle they want to place.<br><br>
        5. Randomized Particle Movement<br><br>
        The step() method in the SandLab class is responsible for simulating the movement and 
        interactions of particles. Particle movements are randomized to create a dynamic and 
        unpredictable simulation.<br><br>
        6. Error Handling and Robustness<br><br>
        The system includes checks to ensure particles do not move outside the grid boundaries.
        Interactions between different particle types, such as sand and water, are handled to 
        ensure realistic behavior.<br><br>
        Conclusion<br><br>
        This Falling Sand Game offers a captivating visual representation of particle behavior 
        and interactions. By allowing users to interactively place and observe particles, the 
        application provides insights into the dynamics of particle systems. Whether used for 
        educational purposes or sheer entertainment, this application serves as a testament to 
        the power of simulation and visualization in understanding complex systems.<br><br>
